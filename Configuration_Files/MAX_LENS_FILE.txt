#File for Matrix dimensions of the AIDA Event Builder
#The dimensions have to be set carefully since the program will
#crash when an excessive amount of RAM is allocated
#
#There are 5 different max_lens for different arrays
#Data_Streamer and Decay_Event_Store can remain untouched
#T_Matrix_Row and TX_Matrix need the highest amount of memory
